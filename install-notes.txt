Most likely, anyone downloading this knows more about R than I do, 
but here are some notes to get you started if you are R-ignorant, 
like myself: 

* Clone the library (hopefully that's already been done, since you 
are reading this)
* Build and check the resulting tarball using R

R CMD build gdbr; R CMD check gdbr_1.0.tar.gz

You should get a few complaints about the man pages. I haven't 
done anything with the skeleton man pages, so...just ignore those.
I don't want to mess with that until we are close to actually
having a real, functional package. That is definitely not now. 

You might need to install LaTeX if you want to avoid any 
misleading errors associated with building those help documents.
If you don't mind a slow download of 2.4 gigs, download MacTeX:
http://www.tug.org/mactex/ and install that package. It works
fine, though, you might need to add /usr/bintex to your PATH.

If the install goes badly about a complaint about gfortran or
libquadmath, you'll probably need to install G++. For the last
couple of versions of OSX, the compile was CLang, which doesn't 
ship with all of the same libraries as does Gcc. The easiest
way to make it all right is to install GCC. If you are a windows
user, google might be helpful here, but I can't offer much
assistance...been way too long.

INSTALLING GCC

If you are running a linux machine and are having this problem, 
you probably just need to add a special package. I haven't 
directly dealth with that, but I'm sure googling "gfortran my-distro"
will help. 

For Mac Users, I recommend brew. I have seen some folks having 
good luck with MacPorts. I've been using homebrew for a while, so
I'm sticking to it. I won't get into installing homebrew here, but
if you are unfamiliar, have a look at: http://brew.sh/

Once it's installed, the process is simple:

brew update; brew doctor
brew install gcc


You might have to delete a few apple binaries (or rename them to
avoid collisions that require sudo rights). If so, be sure to 
pay attention to the link commands brew feeds you. 

Once it's installed properly, you may need to pass that info 
along to R so that it can find the directory during linking:

Inside the file ~/.R/Makevars, add this line:
LDFLAGS += -L/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/4.8.3_1/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin13.2.0/4.8.3/

(of course, make sure you give it the correct path, that is what
mine was, but your version might be different).
